Example Gallery
===============

This gallery contains worked examples demonstrating extreme value analysis
with xtimeseries using real-world climate and environmental datasets.

Each example includes:

- Complete, runnable Python code
- Detailed explanations of the analysis steps
- Visualizations of the results
- Downloadable source files

The examples progress from basic GEV fitting to advanced non-stationary
analysis and model comparison.
